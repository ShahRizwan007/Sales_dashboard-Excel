# Sales_dashboard
In this project I cleaned and analysed more than 1 lakh row data to create  interactive dashboard in Excel for data driven decission making.
So first I import data in power query for data cleaning,In Power query i changes data type of some column like date etc, delete some unwanted column.
I then Duplicate this data set to make new sheet, In that sheet Except City,State and country i removed other column and name this sheet as city_state_country later i will use this  for handling missing value in main data set.
similarly i duplicate main dataset and group by brand column and named this sheet as Brand_count these will help us in future for imputing missing value in brand Column in main data.
